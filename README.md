# ImageGeneration
In this notebook we'll focus our attention on image generation and implement two different generative models:
* A variational autoencoder:

  In this part we will learn to generate new data using a special type of autoencoder model which allows us to 
  sample from it's latent space. We'll implement and train a VAE and use it to generate new images.

* Generative adversarial network:

  In this part we will implement and train a generative adversarial network and apply it to the task of image generation.
